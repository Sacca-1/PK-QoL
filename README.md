# Wildy QoL

A RuneLite plugin that provides quality of life improvements for wilderness activities.

## Features

### Pet Spell Blocker
* Removes "Cast" menu entries on any follower pet (all pets supported)

### Empty Vial Blocker
* Prevents left-clicking "Use" on empty vials while in dangerous areas (wilderness, PvP worlds, Deadman worlds)

### NPC Spell Blocker
* Removes "Cast" menu entries on NPCs while in dangerous areas (wilderness, PvP worlds, Deadman worlds)
* **Warning**: This removes the option to cast spells on NPCs altogether, so make sure you only enable this if you're sure you don't want to cast spells on NPCs

## Future Features

This plugin is designed to be expandable with additional wildy-related quality of life features. Feel free to open an issue if you have any ideas!
